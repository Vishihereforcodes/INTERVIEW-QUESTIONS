 # Data Structures And Algorithms

This repository contains some of the important interview questions on important Data structures and Algorithms topics.

Each algorithm and data structure has its own separate README with related explanations and links for further reading (including ones to YouTube videos).

## Data Structures

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## Algorithms

An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.
